# OncoClass: Multi-Cancer Classification using Hybrid Autoencoders

## 🧬 Project Overview

OncoClass is a bioinformatics tool designed to classify cancer subtypes based on high dimensional RNA-seq data from the **TCGA Pan-Cancer Dataset**.

The project implements a custom neural network architecture called **Deep OncoClass**, which combines an **Autoencoder** for feature extraction with a robust classifier.This approach reduces 20000+ genetic features into a latent space to identify key biological signatures.
